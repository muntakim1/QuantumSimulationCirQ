Recently Google achieved <Strong>Quantum</Strong> Supremacy. Now a question may rised in your mind that What the hell quantum Computer or Quantum is?
For you, According to physics, <strong>Quantum</strong> is a discrete quantity of energy proportional in magnitude to the frequency of the radiation it represents.
<strong>Quantum</strong> computer is a special type of Computer which can process only in qubit. Qubit has states. A qubit could be 0 and 1 at the same time.which is not possible in binarybits.
<strong>Quantum</strong> mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of both states/levels simultaneously, a property which is fundamental to quantum mechanics and quantum computing.
Now What is <strong>Quantum Supremacy</strong>? Answer is, By using <strong>Quantum Computer</strong> we can do such of things which are classical computer are not capable of. 

## About Cirq:

According to their website:

Cirq is a software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits and then running them against quantum computers and simulators. Cirq attempts to expose the details of hardware, instead of abstracting them away, because, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) regime, these details determine whether or not it is possible to execute a circuit at all.

## What is in the notebook?


In this notebook we are going to see a Quantum Circuit's pictorial representation.

<strong>Now in your mind, You may thing about what is Quantum circuit?</strong>

<strong>Answer is: </strong> A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computation in which a computation is a sequence of quantum gates, which are reversible transformations on a quantum mechanical analog of an n-bit register. This analogous structure is referred to as an n-qubit register.

This circuit are build using Quantum Logic gates. Some Gates are:
<li>Hadamard Gate</li>

<li>Pauli's X Gate</li>
